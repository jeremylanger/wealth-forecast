# Wealth Forecast

**Plan for retirement and big life events. Gain insights into how to build wealth faster with the money you already have.**

## Forecast your financial future

Have you wondered how much money you need to retire comfortably? Or if you could get away with retiring a few years earlier? This dynamic financial modeling tool gives you an early look into what your future could look like.

Type in the value of your savings and investment accounts, loans, and real estate. Change variables like retirement age, monthly withdrawal during retirement, life expectancy, life events, and interest rates and see instantly how your finances change.

## How is wealth optimization prioritized?

1. Pay the minimum payments while you build up an emergency fund.
1. Then roll that extra money into your highest interest rate account or debt.
1. During retirement, withdraw from your lowest rate of return account.

## How can I get started?

So glad you made it this far and want to try it out! An example scenario is already loaded out of the gate. If you want to customize this for yourself, you'll need to make a few edits to the source code while the UI for data entry is still being built.

1. Edit `src/profile/accounts.ts` to put in all of your emergency funds, investment and savings accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and real estate.
1. Edit `src/profile/events.ts` for any big life events you want to plan for like a promotion, a child's wedding, or paying for college.
